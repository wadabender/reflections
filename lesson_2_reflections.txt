How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area forces you to consciously add files to change at once.
This can help ensure that you only stage files you know need to go

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Each branch is clearly shown where it is connected to the master.
This allows a programmer to keep track of all the different features.

One branch label is erased and combined with the master branch.
Because the experimental branch was erased, it is almost as if
it was subsumed into the master branch.
