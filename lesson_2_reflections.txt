How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area forces you to consciously add files to change at once.
This can help ensure that you only stage files you know need to go
together.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Ex: making different language versions. They would create different
versions which would allow me to make text changes without effecting
the development of the main english version.
